# Goals 
Analyze the data given by Kempower about EV charging and make research and innovation. These will be used by KemPower to decide on expanding the usage in next year.
# Planning
  - Get access to the Dataset (done)
  - Analyze the results (on progress)
  - Brainstorm ideas to get results from the data set. for example most charged time of the day or month of the year.

    -Currently im planning to work on 2024 as main focus since its a complete year and i can analyze full year cycle easily since 2025 hasnt ended yet, yet briefly show if the trend seen in 2024 still can be seen in 2025.
3.Everyrole goes to ME! :)

5.The research data will be given. ---“Kempower Passenger EV Charging Dataset”---
6.I will save my findings and documents on my local PC since only im accessing them.
7.I will do the testing each time I make considerable progress on the project.
