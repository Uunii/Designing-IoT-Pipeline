# Designing-IoT-Pipeline
KemPower

# Goals 
Analyze the data given by Kempower about EV charging and make research and innovation. These will be used by KemPower to decide on expanding the usage in next year.
# Planning
  - ✅ Get access to the Dataset (done)
  - Analyze the results (on progress)
  - Brainstorm ideas to get results from the data set. For example most charged time of the day or month of the year.

    - Currently I am planning to work on 2024 as main focus year since its a complete year and I can analyze full year cycle easily since 2025 hasn't ended yet, but briefly show if the trend seen in 2024 still can be seen in 2025.
# Roles
  - Every roles goes to me :)
# Communication platform
  - Not needed
# The research data will be given. 
---“Kempower Passenger EV Charging Dataset”---
# Documentation
  - All documentation, dataset, analyzes will be saved on my local machine.
# Testing
  - Since this project is mostly based on analizing the data, testing is not necessary.

# Ideas

- 1.Charging Efficiency Insights per car Model

Compare average power, average current average voltage, and SoC increments per EV model.
 
  -Instead of using just power, calculate the power efficiency
  

- 2.Temperature Impact on Charging Performance

Analyze avgPowerW and SoC changes across temperature

  -Instead using simple averages, calculate percentage drop in charging efficiency per degree change.
  
  -Can suggest seasonal adjustment, specially in countries with high temperature differences in seasons.
  

- 3.Hotspots for Models

Analyze and fnd which Model cars are most popular in which countries 
  
  -Can help to decide where to expand what station
