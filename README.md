# Goals 
Analyze the data given by Kempower about EV charging and make research and innovation. These will be used by KemPower to decide on expanding the usage in next year.
# Planning
  - Get access to the Dataset
  - Analyze the results
  - Brainstorm ideas to get results from the data set.

  - Currently I am planning to work on 2024 as main focus year since its a complete year and I can analyze full year cycle easily since 2025 hasn't ended yet, but briefly show if the trend seen in 2024 still can be seen in 2025.
# Roles
  - I am working on this project by my self, so all roles goes to me.
# Communication platform
  - Not needed
# The research data will be given. 
---“Kempower Passenger EV Charging Dataset”---
# Documentation
  - The dataset and other documentations will be saved on my own local computers then analyzes and other ideas will be saved on github.
# Testing
  - Since this project is mostly based on analizing the data, testing is not necessary.

# Ideas
 - Since the goal of this project is for expanding the business in upcoming year, I will mainly focus on total number of charging sessions.
 - Some sessions have more samples than others so counting them all would be inaccurate, so I will count each unique session by matching their transaction id, EV model and their month and weekday.
